# Neovim from scratch

**Important Update** When I initially created this repo I didn't anticipate the amount of breaking
changes, if you'd like to use the same basic config as this one as a base I recommend my new repo:
[nvim-basic-ide](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide)

**Another Update** This repo should work fine with Neovim 0.8, also all packages are pinned so it
should remain stable.

Each video will be associated with a branch so checkout the one you are interested in, you can
follow along with this

## Try out this config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch.git ~/.config/nvim
```
